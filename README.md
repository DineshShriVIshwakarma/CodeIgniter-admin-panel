CodeIgniter-Sample-Project

Sample administrator panel using CodeIgniter 2.1.2 with Mysql and Twitter Bootstrap.

READ IT FIRST!!!: Guys, i've made this project with the idea to help the community, the idea was to receive suggestions and grow the project along with the community.

Unfortunately (or not) one week after i did this project, i started to work with Ruby and Rails, and kind of did left the php and this project as well. It's too sad check the project one year after its creation and see lots of issues without a single pull request...

Issues are a great opportunity to join and contribute to open source as well help the project to grow. There are some issues with the fix in the comment but no pull requests..

So please... make yourself comfortable to help!
